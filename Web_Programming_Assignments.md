Web Programming Assignments And Projects

## Assignment 1: Comparative Evluation of Website
### Title: Top 6 Traveling Agencies Performance Analysis Using Google Lighthouse Matrix

#### Summary And Reflection:
For this assignment, my groupmates and I conducted a comparative evaluation of websites in the **travel agency domain** using **Google Lighthouse** which is an auditing tool that audits web performances, which include accessibility, best practices, performance, and SEO. Our group, comprising three members including myself, selected six travel agency websites which are **TripAdvisor, Airbnb, Booking.com, Expedia, Skyscanner**, and **Agoda** to be analyzed. Each team member analyzed two websites, generating performance reports using Google Lighthouse for comparison. Our evaluation revealed that TripAdvisor performed the best overall among the six websites. Skyscanner scored the highest in accessibility while Airbnb and Expedia excelled in best practices. Expedia emerged as the leader in SEO evaluation. On the other hand, Agoda had the lowest overall performance among the audited websites.

#### Improvement Suggestion:
To improve future evaluations, it would be beneficial to consider additional metrics beyond those provided by Google Lighthouse. These could include user experience testing and a deeper examination of website content relevance. In my opinion, **conducting surveys** with users could also provide valuable insights into their preferences and expectations of the website, further enhancing the evaluation process.

## Assignment 2: Design and Develop Personal Website Landing Page
### Title: Aliyah's Personal Website
#### Summary And Reflection:
I was tasked with designing and developing a single-page personal website landing page using HTML and CSS grid layouts. I used the web browser's inspect element tool to identify specifications and elements to be implemented on my own website. I structured my webpage into sections with a navigation bar at the top and left side of the page for easy navigation of different sections such as personal information, interest, and achievement content throughout the website. On the website, I included descriptive text and images to make the content more engaging and reflective of my personality. For styling the website, I used CSS to personalize the visual of my webpage. Lastly, I used 000webhost, which is a free web hosting service, to publish my webpage and make it more accessible. By completing this assignment, I enhanced my skills in HTML and CSS as I applied it right after learning it in class which gives me a deeper understanding of the importance of a well-structured and visually appealing webpage. It also taught me the value of responsive design in ensuring that the webpage looks good and functions well on various devices

Take a look at the [website](https://mypersonalwebsite-wpbynaas.000webhostapp.com/assignment2.html ) I created using HTML and CSS!

#### Improvement Suggestion:
To further improve the project, I could explore more advanced CSS techniques and animations to make the page more interactive and visually appealing according to my styling. Additionally, I could also use JavaScript to add more functionality to the webpage, such as interactive elements  but this and PHP will be implemented in my final project for my Web Programming course.
